    "# N-grams, Fastttext, and GloVE\n",
    "\n",
    "*This assignment focuses on exploring Fasttext and GloVE as NLP methods. We are going to focus on two tasks and ways of understanding models:*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *The traditional, \"model is a classifier\" viewpoint. Here we are going to work with the [AG News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amananandrai/ag-news-classification-dataset) to classify genres*\n",
    "2. *The more vector-based way, seeing them basically as machines that just generate word vectors, with everything else just being gravy. Barring attaching a specific classifier, GloVE falls entirely under this category.* \n",
    "\n",
    "*In this assignment, we are mainly going to be using the [AG News Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amananandrai/ag-news-classification-dataset), a corpus of more than 1 million news articles, each classified as one of four classes: 'Business', 'Sci/Tech', 'World', or 'Sports'. Note, that because of the semi-supervised nature of most methods used in this assignment, we could almost do the whole thing without the labels. They're just there to make it a bit simpler and to provide an obvious usecase.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**For the GloVe part, note that you can download all their pretrained vectors at the [GloVe project page](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0. Extra primer on Fasttext\n",
    "\n",
    "*As you know, n-grams are pretty useful for improving the otherwise limited bag-of-words (BoW) model. Most often, this is by making distinctions between sentences such as \"good\" and \"not good\" which would be represented somewhat the same in a regular BoW. It is very obvious if we consider the sentence \"Maria stole the milk\" vs \"The milk stole Maria\", two sentences completely identical in the BoW representation, but with two obviously different meanings.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*As you also know, Fasttext takes this further by creating chracter-wise n-grams. These are made up of n-characters of a single word. This allows fasttext to consider cases such as grammar, where words are spelled similarly and even consider misspellings, if someone makes a mistaek in wirtign a wrod, the character-wise n-gram representation will be **almost** the same as the correct word.*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is done by Fasttext simply storing embedding vectors $v_n$ for each n-gram, character or otherwise. Fasttext will simply then average all of these vectors, word, character-wise n-grams, and word-wise n-grams to create the representation for a given text or sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$v_{total} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum^N_{n=0} v_n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important note: Fasttext supervised and unsupervised\n",
    "\n",
    "*If you look into the technical documentation for the fasttext model, you'll notice that there are options to train both an **unsupervised** and a **supervised** version of the fasttext model. These use similar approaches, but it is arguably the unsupervised model that best describes what the fasttext team wanted to accomplish: efficient word-vector generation for downstream usage.*\n",
    "\n",
    "***The supervised model:***\n",
    "- *Needs a corpus of text with given labels to train*\n",
    "- *Does not use skipgram/CBoW, but just works as a 'normal' FFN for classification*\n",
    "- *Uses character-wise n-grams*\n",
    "- *Uses word-wise n-grams the same way as the unsupervised model uses character-wise n-grams, treating them as vectors and combining them in the end for the final classification.*\n",
    "- *Can be directly evaluated by just checking how good it is at predicting the given classes.*\n",
    "\n",
    "***The unsupervised model:*** (not important for this assignment or course, just cool to know)\n",
    "- *Just needs a corpus of text to train*\n",
    "- *Does not use wordwise n-grams*\n",
    "- *Has vectors for each unique character n-gram and each unique word in the corpus (limited by bin size)* \n",
    "- *Vectors for character n-grams are created indepedently of word vectors, for example the trigram \"her\" present in \"where\" has a different vector representation than the one for the full word \"her\".*\n",
    "- *Is a purely skipgram/CBoW model (input layer, one hidden, output layer)*\n",
    "- *Cannot be directly evaluated except in qualitative ways by considering the downstream tasks it will be used in*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***Both models***\n",
    "- *Only work on CPU (bvadr) (what a time 2015 was!)*"

    "### Fasttext - Theoretical questions\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. In general, how does fasttext handle OOV (out of vocabulary) tokens? How do they contribute to embeddings vectors?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In FastText, OOV tokens are split into character n-grams, for which an embedding can be found individually by looking it up in the subword embedding matrix, which was learned during training. Then all the character n-grams are averaged to obtain an embedding for the full word. \n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Say you have a fasttext model trained on a large corpus with character-3-grams how would it reprsent the OOV word \"Phandelver\"?.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The model would split the OOV word into subwords, as explained above. For n=3 this would look as such:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ph, han, and, nde, del, elv, lve, ver, er>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: We write a \"p\" instead of a \"P\" since the preprocessing lowers all uppercase letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. In probability theory, you often consider either the marignal probability $p(x)$, or the conditional probability $p(x|y)$. How do these two different kinds of probability relate to the field of natural language processing?**\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>\"Words that appear together, relate together\"</i></p>\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:center;\">- From slides</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The marginal probability represents the probability of a word appearing in a corpus of text and it is calculated by dividing the amount of times the word occurs divided by the total amount of words in the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "However the condition probability represents the probability of words appearing in succession. Among other applications, this can help us predict the next word based on the previous word.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, suppose y denotes an arbitrary word, and x denotes the word following y. In this case, the conditional probability $p(x|y)$ represents the probability that the word following y is x. Hence by maximizing the conditional probability, we can predict the next word in a sentence based on the previous word. Auto-correct in phones is a great example of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- The marginal probability relates to the number of times a word appears in a corpus, while the conditional probability is the probability of a word given the previous word. -->\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Word2Vec is pretty old method in NLP, now mostly supplanted by attention-based models. What disadvantages are there in using specific word vectors for text classification? As inspiration, consider a fasttext model being given the following question:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Mary saw a puppy in the window, she wanted it. James saw a nice window in the window store, he wanted it. What did Mary want?*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Contextual Understanding:\n",
    "Word2Vec generates static embeddings, meaning that each word has a fixed representation regardless of its context. For example, in the sentence above, Word2Vec might incorrectly associate “it” with “window” rather than “puppy,” as it doesn’t encode the relationship between words in context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling Polysemy:\n",
    "As words are encoded independant of their context, sometimes words can have multiple meanings, leading to ambiguity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) Words:\n",
    "Word2Vec cannot handle words not seen during training, as it requires a pre-trained embedding for each word. In contrast, FastText uses subword (e.g., n-gram) embeddings, enabling it to approximate embeddings for OOV words by combining representations of their subwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "Storage Requirements:\n",
    "Word2Vec requires storing an embedding for every word in the vocabulary, which can be computationally expensive for large corpora. FastText, by operating on subword units, reduces storage demands and increases efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\star$ **5. As mentioned, attention-based models fix a lot of issues that older Word2Vec models had. Particularly, they do not need N-grams to capture context information. Why is this?**\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\dots$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\star$ **6. Because of the way fasttext generates word-vectors (skipgram/CBoW), it only ever considers local contexts and not whole corpora at a time. What potential downsides does this have?**\n",

    "*GloVe is called a \"global log-bilinear regression model\" which combines the strengths of global matrix factorization and local context window methods.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*In English, this means it combines methods that work by collecting information on the entire corpus, with other methods that capture more local patterns, essentially what we see with Fasttext that considers local n-grams. GloVe just considers \"context windows\" rather than an n-gram. Overall, what they want are nicely defined, linear relationships, decided by comparing the co-occurences of different words.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*The selling point really, is that while a run-of-the-mill neural network **may** be able to answer the questions: \"Skibidi is to Toilet as Fanum is to ...?\", it will not necessarily be able to do it in a linear manner. Therefore considering all the word vectors together in their latent space, may not yield good information. GloVe fixes this by keeping all vector substructures linear.*\n",

Because GloVe works best on huge corpora of data, we are not going to train it ourselves, but just use pretrained GloVe vectors, collected from their [project page](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).* \n",

    "### GloVe - Theoretical questions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. On their project page, GloVe gives a few different possibilities for GloVe vectors, including ones with embedding dimension 50, 100, 200, and 300. What potential downsides and upsides are there to larger/smaller embedding dimensions? Consider both training and subsequent usage.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The GloVe vector sets are collections of pre-trained vector embeddings, which come in multiple sizes. While the larger embeddings allow for richer representations, they increase training and inference costs, unlike smaller embeddings, which are computationally lighter but may struggle to capture nuanced relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "High-dimensional embeddings allow the vectors to capture more context, since larger embeddings have a greater amount of tunable parameters. While the smaller vectors capture the most important contexts, a larger dimension can better represent words with subtle semantic differences. However diminishing returns may occur beyond a certain size. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Overfitting**\n",
    "\n",
    "While larger dimensions can capture more context, they might also risk overfitting due to their ability to capture subtle details, especially if the training data is insufficient. Essentially, while the low-dimensional embeddings capture the general trends in the data, the high-dimensional vectors will have more opportunity to fit the data on more parameters, which can sometimes be a good thing and sometimes a bad thing, depending on the size and quality of the dataset. This also means that for small datasets it would typically be a good choice to use a smaller embedding size, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Computational efficiency**\n",
    "\n",
    "High dimensional embeddings also mean more expensive computations, both during training and for downstream tasks. If using the Transformer architecture, the positional embeddings must match the dimensionality of the word embeddings. While sinusoidal positional encodings, using the harmonic bases, are computationally efficient, learned positional embeddings could increase computational cost during training, due to backpropagation running over a larger parameter space, and slower inference due to matrix operations and dot product operations on higher-dimensional vectors. '\n",
    "\n",
    "Larger embeddings also require more memory for storage. The embedding size directly scales the number of parameters in the embedding layer. For a vocabulary of size $V$ and embedding size $D$, the embedding layer will have $V \\times D$ parameters. This means that the amount of memory that must be allocated for storing the vectors, increases linearly with the embedding size.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Also on their webage, they give two options for the \"Common Crawl\" GloVe vector set: \"42B tokens, 1.9M vocab, 300d vectors\" and \"840B tokens, 2.2M vocab, 300d vectors\". What are the differences between these?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Both GloVe vector sets are rather large, however the smallest one (40B tokens) is a subset of the larger corpus (840B tokens), which covers more text and is likely to contain richer and more diverse linguistic patterns, leading to potentially better embeddings for rare or less frequent words.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Given just a bunch of embedding vectors from a known GloVe embedding, it is usually not possible to get a 1-1 correspondance of what words these vectors were. Why is this?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason it is typically not possible to establish a 1-1 correspondence between embedding vectors from different models is that the vectors themselves do not contain information about their corresponding words. Embeddings rely on an external vocabulary file to map each vector to its associated word, which is a list of all the words in the model’s vocabulary, stored in a fixed order. The order of words in this vocabulary file determines the correspondence between rows in the embedding matrix and their associated words.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. How would you most closely estabilsh this 1-1 correspondance between given vectors from a known GloVe embedding and their corresponding words?**\n",
    "\n",
    "When embeddings come from a different model (e.g., trained on a different corpus or with different hyperparameters), the latent spaces, where semantic relationships are encoded, may differ. This variance in the semantic spaces means that the same or similar vector values in one model might correspond to entirely different words in another. Additionally, the relationships between vectors, such as distances and directions that encode semantic meaning, can vary between models, further complicating any attempt at direct correspondence.\n",
    "\n",
    "However one way to closely establish a 1-1 correspondence between vectors and their words is by leveraging relative representations, which preserves the relationships between vectors, such as distances and directions in the embedding space. These relationships often encode semantic meaning and can be used to align embeddings or approximate word mappings without needing the original vocabulary file.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process can involve techniques like zero-shot stitching, where embeddings are aligned or mapped based on their relative structures (e.g., using known anchor points or inference methods). While relative representation allows for reconstructing or aligning embeddings effectively, absolute representation (the raw numerical values of vectors) alone does not provide enough information to recover the word mappings directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\star$ **5. Why can't we just use a Python dictionary with vectors as keys and words as values? (essentially a reverse GloVe dictionary)**\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\dots$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\star$ **6. In the GloVe paper, they say they attempt to model $F(w_i, w_j, \\tilde{w_k}) = \\frac{P_{ik}}{P_jk}$. That is, the probability of one word given another, compared to the probability of that same word given a third word. For this, they briefly consider using a neural network as the function $F$ but decide against it, as \"doing so would obfuscate the linear strcutures we are trying to capture\", what linear structures are talked about and how would they be obfuscated by using something like a neural network?**\n",

    "### Word Embeddings - Theoretical questions\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Explain shortly what you expect to find if we perform PCA on the matrix of word-embeddings, that is the matrix which holds a vector representation of each word in our vocabulary**\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly we would expect to see some relatively dense clustering within each of the groups, since we have a very large amount of datapoints. Secondly we would expect to see some overlap between clusters, and since business and science/technology is very closely related we would expect those clusters to have the most significant overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the first and second principal components explains the greatest amount of variance in the data, hence we expect these components to give us the best clustering overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. When getting vectors for all words in a large text, GloVe should be significantly faster than Fasttext, why is this?**\n",
    "\n",
    "GloVe already has the pretained vector embeddings, which means that retrieving a words embedding is essentially a lookup operation in constant time per word, while the Fasttext on the other hand represents words using subword embeddings (e.g., n-grams). This means that Fasttext has to compute the embedding by combining embeddings for its subword components for each word, which is a lot more demanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "We note that GloVe embeddings have no way of handling out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words natively, whilst Fasttext can do this by leveraging its subword structure. This means that GloVe provides no meaningful representation for OOV words. However since we are dealing with a large dataset, this is less of an issue, since the vocabulary is large and OOV words for that reason are less common.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Which model (GloVe or fasttext) do you think performs best at seperating the four classes of the AG News dataset if we get average embedding vectors for each text in the training and testing dataset, perform PCA on these and plot them on the two top principal components. And why do you think that model performs best at seperating the four classes?**\n",
    "\n",
    "GloVe stores the context in the embeddings, while fasttext learns embeddings based on subword (n-gram) information. For this reason, we expect GloVe to perform better in this classification task, since the classification is made based on the context of each sentence and not the semantic similarity. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance GloVe captures the inherent contextual relationship between the vectors for \"king\" and \"queen\".\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\text{vec}(\\text{“king”}) - \\text{vec}(\\text{“man”}) + \\text{vec}(\\text{“woman”}) \\approx \\text{vec}(\\text{“queen”}) $\n",
    "\n",
    "While Fasttext instead looks at how similar the words and their n-grams are semantically.\n",
    " \n",
    "In Fasttext the “king” and “queen” representations are influenced by their shared character-level components (e.g. the insersection between their n-grams.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance $(<qu, que, uee, een, en>, <quee, ueen>, <queen>)$ and $(<ki, kin, ing, ng> , <kin, king, ing> , <king, king>)$. Note while queen and king shares contextual similarity they have no subwords (n-grams) in common.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that Fasttext will not represent high-level relationships like $\\text{“king”} - \\text{“man”} + \\text{“woman”} = \\text{“queen”}$ effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "However since FastText captures the semantic relationships between words. Words like “goal,” “match,” and “player” (related to Sports) will have embeddings close to each other because they frequently co-occur in sports-related texts. This can provide some degree of meaningful separation between sentence clusters."

    "All three models were able to capture differences between categories effectively, as demonstrated by the clustering results. For all models, clusters for the categories (e.g., “World,” “Sports,” “Business,” and “Science/Technology”) are generally distinct, particularly along PC1 and PC2. This indicates that the embeddings from each model encode meaningful relationships between the categories. However, some overlap, especially between “Business” and “Sci/Tech,” is still evident. This is expected since these domains often share vocabulary and context.\n",
    "\n",
    "For FastText, both the character and word models show strong performance in concentrating variance into the first few dimensions. The explained variance (EV) was 0.7924 for the character model and 0.7626 for the word model. These results suggest that FastText embeddings encode their most meaningful information in a small number of dimensions, making them well-suited for low-dimensional tasks like clustering and visualization. The explained variance plots for FastText models further emphasize this, with the curves saturating quickly after just a few components.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the GloVe model shows a lower EV of 0.3053, indicating that its top principal components capture far less variance than the FastText models. The explained variance plot for GloVe exhibits a slower, logistic-like growth, reflecting the model’s reliance on a larger number of dimensions to effectively represent the data. While this limits its effectiveness in reduced-dimensional spaces, it does not necessarily imply that GloVe is inferior overall. Instead, it highlights that GloVe embeddings spread their information across more dimensions, potentially allowing for nuanced representations in high-dimensional tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion:\n",
    "While all models demonstrated the ability to cluster categories effectively, FastText outperforms GloVe in representing clusters in lower-dimensional spaces. This makes FastText better suited for tasks that rely on dimensionality reduction. However, GloVe may excel in high-dimensional applications where the full embedding space can be utilized to capture more nuanced contextual information. The choice between these models should therefore depend on the specific task and whether low-dimensional or high-dimensional representations are more critical."

The clusters observed in 2D are approximations and may not fully capture the true relationships in the original high-dimensional space. Additionally, the explained variance of the selected components should be carefully evaluated to ensure that a meaningful proportion of the variance is retained.\n"

Try to make the fasttext_word_model as bad as possible while the fasttext_char_model still keeps somewhat good performance. Comment on what you did to achieve this.**\n",
    "\n",
    "As the $p$ value increases, the performance of both models worsens. This is because the $p$ value represents the probability of inserted noise in the text. The character-wise model performs way better here, due to its ability to discern character-wise patterns, while the word-wise is unable to find a decent pattern. The extra scuffed option further decreases performance by replacing characters with any other character in the test set, while disabling it only replaces with lowercase letters, which simulates common misspellings. You can imagine this would only further mess up the word-wise model, but also decrease character-wise performance by a little.\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance for the character-wise model could still be further improved by training the fasttext model on noisy data generated from the dyslexibot, while the word-wise model still wouldn't gain as much from this, since the words are dyslexified at random.\n",

For the prediction of mixed topics, we just check if it has either one correct.
